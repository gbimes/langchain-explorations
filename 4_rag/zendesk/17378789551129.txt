<h1>Teacher Statistics: The Basics</h1>
<h3><span style="color: #434343;">Some basics to keep in mind. </span></h3>
<ul>
<li>A month is defined, as the time from the first day of the month 00:00:00 UTC-0 to the last day of the month 23:59:59 UTC-0.</li>
<li>As lesson confirmation, lesson declines, and other events can happen over the end of a month i.e. the lesson was on the 31st and confirmed on the 2nd, you can see monthly totals adjusted after the end of the month.</li>
<li>Finally, remember that the latest month shown is “live” meaning that data can change frequently as the month progresses. The statistics are updated daily, around 02:30 UTC-0</li>
</ul>
