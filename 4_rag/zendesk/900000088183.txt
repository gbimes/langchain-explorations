<h1>Case study: Teaching a Non-Native Language</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many instances where a teacher receives fewer lesson requests than expected and one the reasons may be that the teacher is teaching a non-native language. Is teaching a non-native language a recipe for failure on italki? Do all italki students prefer native speaking teachers? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many italki teachers who teach non-native languages successfully. These teachers tend to have solid teaching qualifications and teaching experience. Some Professional </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will emphasize their qualifications and mention their experience living in the country of their teaching language on their profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the example below, this English Community Tutor has taken the OOPT test and achieved C2, which demonstrates their English proficiency level.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example 1:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example 2:</span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<p>Some teachers teach<strong> several languages including their native language. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Good reviews and statistics obtained from your native language teaching will impress all students, including those who would like to learn other languages with you.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/900000196103" alt="Screenshot_2020-01-09_at_11.27.04.png" width="610" height="217"></span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Many teachers open up their availability and cater their lessons to the student market of their native language countries.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We see that some students will prefer teachers who can speak their native language, particularly beginners. Teaching beginners requires a bridge language to help students understand vocabulary and grammar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a  beginner student from China might like to learn English with an English teacher who can speak Chinese. This gives teachers who can speak Chinese fluently an advantage. Most teachers offer courses for beginners and understand that their availability needs to match the prefered lesson times of their target markets. Other teachers offer specialized courses which support the national syllabus for kids and teenagers in their native country. This is something that native language teachers struggle to compete with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the strategies mentioned, offering Trial Lessons, Informal Tutoring lessons and a lower price also helps especially for those who do not have a strong professional background in teaching their non-native language. We strongly suggest starting with a lower price to attract new students and then raise prices after 30-40 completed lessons.</span></p>
