<strong>Open up your Schedule!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are going to be looking to have many classes during the language challenge, so it goes without saying that they will need available times to book with their favorite teachers, and if you are a new teacher it is a perfect time to connect with students looking for new experiences in learning!</span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JET86P9D058VHHAPQKW64XTT"><strong>Keep your Students Motivated!</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to any goal is to maintain motivation and reach the end. How can you help your students reach their language challenge goals? Check out our article on </span><a href="https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000093783-Tips-to-motivate-your-students-to-keep-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips to motivate your students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JET86P9D7W6CSEV4DZVFS3BT"><strong>Create Custom Language Challenge Plans for your students!</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can a student achieve in 24 hours of lessons in a single month? That depends on their plan! Ask them if they have a goal in mind beyond winning the challenge. Maybe there is an old topic that needs a brush-up or a new one waiting to be tackled? Are there points they still struggle with?  </span></p>

<strong>Set Some Special Language Challenge Packages and Rates!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Language Challenge is a time to think “quantity”. The minimum challenge hours are 12, so students will look to book a lot of packages to set themselves up to win. It can be better to sell 10 lessons at $20, than 6 lessons at $25. </span></p>
