<h1>How do you find your new student’s learning information?</h1>
<p>We encourage teachers to look at their new student's learning profile and prepare their lesson plan according to the student’s learning goals and lesson frequency.</p>
<p>When you first match with your student, their learning profile with information such as learning goals, learning preferences, language level and so on, will appear both on a tab when selecting their chat conversation and their student profile page as seen below.  </p>

<p>We will continue to encourage students to update their learning Preferences closely. If you notice any discrepancies, you can encourage students to update their profiles.</p>
