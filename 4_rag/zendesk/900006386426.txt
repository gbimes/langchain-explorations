<h3><span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>*Noted</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>The global marketing team is going to exclude the list of italki teachers from the audience targeting so as to avoid teachers seeing these ads.<span> </span></strong><span>However, we noticed that only 50% of the teachers in the list </span><span>actually match with the email address available in the list, meaning there is a chance that some of the teachers see these ads and write to us asking how they can get featured in the future. Normally, we're able to exclude 70-80% of the audience targeting, but not in this case. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">* You can apply a macro "General::EN::Value for Money Campaign" to reply to teachers who ask why they are not being selected.</span></p>
