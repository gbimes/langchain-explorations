<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/900001505746" alt="Screenshot_2020-05-21_at_15.19.56.png" width="357" height="154"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to build your fanbase on Facebook. Once you’ve created a strong following, you may use status updates or photos to share your teaching profile on italki. You should also post engaging content that your followers will respond to, such as traveling content, language learning tips, and cultural traditions. The more people like or comment on your updates, the more frequently you will appear in other people’s timelines, which will expand your reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also join and post in Facebook groups that are relevant to your content. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the search bar to find groups that are linked to your specific area of expertise, then you’ll be able to share your insights and </span><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-complete-guide-to-building-your-personal-brand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build authority around your personal brand.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure to join the group as a genuine member, and don’t spam your teaching business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start by joining italki’s own Facebook community: </span><strong>For the love of languages</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram is considered to be the most engaging social media platform for younger audiences aged 18 and 24 years old. By keeping audiences focused on the content, Instagram creates an experience where users can express themselves with real experiences and create genuine interactions without distractions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the hashtag #italkiteacher to let potential students know where they can schedule a lesson with you. Create engaging Instagram content alongside the hashtag and interact with followers to potentially attract new students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of promoting teaching profile on Instagram:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short video clips showing where you are doing right now (ie. having lunch in a restaurant) and how to express it in your teaching language. This can be a good way to engage with your audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also post an image or a video about a word related to seasonal activities. For example, ice cream is perfect for summertime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/900001500803" alt="Screenshot_2020-05-21_at_10.58.51.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also post interesting questions related to cultural traditions.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Youtube</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is one of the most famous video-sharing platforms in the world. On your channel, you can share videos, create playlists, and spark discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube was acquired by Google in 2006, which means that Google search gives priority to Youtube content in search results. Not only are videos much more engaging and shareable than text content, but they’ll help with your search rankings on Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that you create videos that are of high quality, both in content and production. You don’t have to have expensive equipment, but pay attention to sound quality, lighting, and your background. Make sure your camera is stable (a tripod is useful for this). You can also use some free video editing software such as </span><a href="https://blog.storyblocks.com/video-tutorials/getting-started-imovie/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iMovie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to edit your videos for better effects.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter is a platform for fast and concise posts where 280 characters is the limit. When marketing your profile on Twitter, you have to make sure the content is attractive enough for people to stop and click through instead of scrolling through quickly without noticing it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a following, you can start tweeting using the hashtag</span><strong> #italkiteacher</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let potential students know where you’re teaching and how they can schedule a lesson with you. Get involved in discussions, and if you’re a passionate teacher and you see people asking language questions or posting interesting language content, you can build connections engage through comments, retweets, replies. </span></p>
