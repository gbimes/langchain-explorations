<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With <span>Auto-accept</span>, you won’t have to respond to each lesson request individually and this will help to prevent lesson requests from expiring. Your students will also have a better user experience with <span>Auto-accept</span> as they don't have to wait for your response after sending you a lesson request and the lesson request will be immediately accepted by the system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Auto-accept </span>can be found in the Availability Settings under the Teacher Settings menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn on <span>Auto-accept</span> or change who you accept lesson requests from, you will need to enter your password. Lessons requests sent to you before you turn on <span>Auto-accept</span> will not be affected and you will still have to respond to them manually. <span>Auto-accept</span> will be disabled if you missed more than 1 lesson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enable this feature, lesson requests from new students and/or current students will be automatically accepted and will appear in “Upcoming Lessons” instead of “Action Required”.  You will receive an email notification after a lesson request is automatically accepted. You can choose whether or not you would like to automatically accept lesson requests from new students and/or current students. </span></p>
