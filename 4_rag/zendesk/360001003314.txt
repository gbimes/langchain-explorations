<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for reaching out to us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your response has been received.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have checked your reports. It shows you were unable to accept these students' lesson requests or attend the lessons because you were sick.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For lesson requests, if you are not able to accept them because of sickness or other reasons, you'll still need to decline them, otherwise they would expire and you'll receive a response mark.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers receive notifications on italki and emails of new lesson requests, so italki expects that teachers will be attentive and respond promptly by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accepting the lesson request</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Declining the lesson request</strong> (please also send a message to the student to explain)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modifying the details (the student must accept or decline the modification)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not respond in any of these ways, then the lesson request will expire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For attendance, if you have already told your student beforehand that you would not be able to give the lesson, please choose (or ask your student to choose) the reason "Reached a prior agreement" instead of "The teacher did not attend the lesson", which will give you an attendance mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have gone ahead and dismissed the report just for this time. </span></span>When you are ready to accept new requests, you can activate your teaching profile<span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><strong>Teacher Profile</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &gt; </span><strong>Teacher Status</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &gt; click the “pencil” icon to edit your status to</span><strong> “I’m looking for new students”.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you very much for your response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems your response to these two lesson requests didn't go through as the system shows both actually expired. I guess something was not perhaps working properly with the app.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span class="wysiwyg-color-black60"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">#7378379087</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018-02-10 20:36</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2]This lesson request has expired.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018-02-08 20:33</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0]Student sent a new lesson request.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a reminding message so it won't affect your profile visibility or status. I'm also going to dismiss this report as it looks like a technical issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>In the future, we suggest that you may refresh the page after you responded to the lesson request just to double check. And hopefully this issue can be avoided. </span></p>

Yes, you responded to the student and didn't get a response to your lesson detail change request. It shouldn't be an expired lesson request for you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I've just dismissed this report from your account and will ask our tech team to fix this issue.</span></p>
