<h1>Package Dispute</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a package is requested to be terminated but declined by the other party, the package is </span><strong>disputed</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you have talked with the other party about your termination decision to avoid any package dispute.</span></p>
<p><strong>The one who initiates the termination will receive an email</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from italki asking for a reason and explanation. It is optional for the other party to also contact support explaining the reason for declining the termination request. Our support team will settle the italki credits based on the materials provided in 3 days from the date of the dispute. </span><strong>All italki decisions are final. </strong></p>
