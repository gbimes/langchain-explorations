<h1>Thumbnail DOs and DON'Ts</h1>
<p>Your thumbnail (along with your profile picture and introduction video) plays a vital role in how your teacher page is perceived by the potential students and how many of them get interested enough and book a lesson with you. Having a great thumbnail can increase your business by 15%. </p>
<p>Here we have collected some examples of what a great thumbnail should be like.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>1. Well-designed thumbnail with the teacher clearly seen and text easy to read.</strong></h4>
<p>Simple artistic design, a smiling teacher, and a call to action will demonstrate to students your professionalism.</p>

<p>(either one of them or both)</p>

<p>On the other hand, this is what you do not want to have on your thumbnail, <strong>the teacher's face cannot be clearly seen, the image is too busy, and the message is lost.</strong></p>

<h4><strong>2. High-quality photo with unique highlights about the teacher.</strong></h4>
<p>Your thumbnail can serve as a banner, attract and inform students about yourself even before they clicked on your profile, think about what makes you stand out, and put it on your thumbnail.</p>

<p>with all the above-mentioned, <strong>please do not overdo it, too much information might scare students away, and it is difficult to arrange to make it look good</strong>, nobody wants to end up with something like that:</p>

<h4><strong>3. You do not necessarily need to be in your thumbnail but make sure it looks professional and appealing. </strong></h4>

<p> </p>
<p>Every aspect of your profile sends a non-verbal message to students: the effort that has been put in, the teacher's approach to the things they do, and many others. </p>
<p>Most of the time, the student's decisions will be based on what they have seen, that is why we as teachers need to try our best and make sure students like what they see.</p>
