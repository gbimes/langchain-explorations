<h2><strong>FAQ:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. What if the user failed or forgot to use the purchase coupon "Buy $140 get $14 more" and "Buy $500 get $56 more"?</strong></p>
<p>If you got tickets asking to add the $14 or $56 amount since user forgot or failed to use the purchase coupon, please record the details in this sheet<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSuhixr9ogw_pTDboLWLEFIl0WkSpstZ_xyOx98h-Lc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_self">" Top-up issue recording"</a>. MKT team will give the name list to the finance team to manually add value for those users.  CS can reply with macro ”General::EN::14th Anniversary Campaign top-up issue“</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.What if the user complains no refund is given for the lessons and packages purchased with lesson coupons?</strong></p>
<p><span>Based on system logic, if the amount refunds to student &lt; lesson coupon value, </span><strong>no refund will be given. </strong>In case user complains that they should get a refund, please record the required details in the sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSuhixr9ogw_pTDboLWLEFIl0WkSpstZ_xyOx98h-Lc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_self">"Lesson/Package refund recording"</a> and @Exy please assist with the credit adjustment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3.How does it looks like OMS when the user applied a lesson coupon during lesson/package purchase?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/4402999369369/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4.For the anniversary reward to teachers,  Can they give "Buy Any Get $5 Off" coupons to their current students?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, these coupons can only be used by newly registered students who sign up to get the coupon.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5.How many "Buy Any Get $5 Off" coupons can teachers give away?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of coupons teachers get will be their total commission (for lessons taught on 30 July and completed before 4 August) divided by 5. For example, if the total commission is $22.5 USD, the teacher will receive 5 coupons (rounding up from 4.5). The minimum total commission required for 1 coupon is 0.75 USD.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>6.When will teachers get their "Buy Any Get $5 Off" coupons to give to potential students? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will receive an email and an internal message(IM) from italki with their sharing link on </span><strong>5 August, 2021.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>7.Where can the teacher share the link?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can share the link on social media or any other public platform.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8.Can the teacher share the link multiple times?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, but once all of their coupons have been claimed, potential students can only view the teacher's profile. The link will expire on<strong> 31 Dec, 23:59:59 (UTC+0)</strong> 2021.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Know Issue after campaign release:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.When users shared a journey, if they only click "copy link", this is not considered as successful sharing. Even if they share the copied link to social media platform they cannot get the coupon pack.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Wechat mini program didn't support the usage of coupon packs, we can advise user to download APP.</span></p>
