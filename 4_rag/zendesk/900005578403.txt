<h1>The Power of Music in Language Learning</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to music in a foreign language can make learning fun, what else can it do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a non-linguistic perspective, language is more than just words. Language and culture are intertwined. As many learners will tell you, they fell in love with the culture before deciding to pursue the language!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you share your culture's music with a student, you’re sharing how native speakers express themselves. As well as teaching new vocabulary, music reflects the country’s lifestyle, attitudes, and values. Research from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Degrave (2019)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also shown how music can reduce foreign language anxiety, help develop musical intelligence, increase motivation and sustain attention.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a more linguistic perspective, music can help students’ listening comprehension, pronunciation, and master new vocabulary without feeling burdened by memorization.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how can you use music to teach a language?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cloze the lyrics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a song with words or phrases that your student struggles with or has just recently learned.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the key words or phrases you would like your student to memorize.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delete those words in the lyrics and replace them with blank gaps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print out the lyrics and ask your student to fill in the blanks while listening to the song. The student may want to listen multiple times depending on the level of difficulty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give feedback and correction. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sing the song together with the student and correct their pronunciation.</span></li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Play “What happened?”</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before introducing a new song to your student, go over the new vocabulary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to the song with your student.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your student what the song is about. How does the singer feel? What cultural characteristics do they notice in the song?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide feedback and review new words.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sing the song together with your student and correct their pronunciation.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My Song</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a song that your student knows.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your student to create variations to the song and make it personal. They don’t have to keep the original meaning of the song, but they should be grammatically correct.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide feedback.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sing the song together with your student and correct their pronunciation.</span></li>
