<h1>Tax Identification Number (TIN)</h1>
<h3 id="reportable-information-tax-identification-number">Tax Identification Number</h3>
<p>The taxpayer identification number (TIN) is the unique identifier assigned to the Account Holder by the tax administration in the Account Holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence. It is a unique combination of letters and/or numbers used to identify an individual or entity for the purposes of administering the tax laws of that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Any identifier assigned by a jurisdiction of source, for example, for identifying a person whose income has been subject to withholding tax at source, should not be reported.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not issue a TIN and where that is the case there will be nothing to report unless they use other high integrity numbers with an equivalent level of identification. For individuals these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social security number</li>
<li>National insurance number</li>
<li>Citizen or personal identification code or number</li>
<li>Resident registration number</li>
</ul>
