<h1>2020 San Isidro Campaign (0512-0524)</h1>
<h1><strong>Who is San Isidro and why are we celebrating?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every 15th of May, Madrid and other regions in Spain celebrate the Festival of San Isidro, the patron saint of Madrid. During the span of a week, Madrid hosts a packed program of different activities including traditional dancing, live music, and outdoor picnics among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we face unprecedented changes this year, many festivities have been canceled.  We hope to support our growing community by connecting people through languages.  Explore a new culture or celebrate your own.</span></p>
