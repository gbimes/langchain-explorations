<h1>SOP: Re-application policy for TMS deactivated teachers</h1>
<p>Teachers who have had 4 or more missed lesson reports will be automatically deactivated by TMS.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Conditions</strong></h3>
<p>For a missed lesson report, we expect the teacher:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give the student prior notice as soon as they can if they won't be able to attend the lesson. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least explain to the student with detailed reason for the missed lesson after the lesson. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the teacher does not meet the 2 conditions above, then we consider this lesson is a <strong>real</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unattended lesson and this is really </span><strong>bad</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behaviour.</span></p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h3><strong>Re-application policy</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. If the teacher has had <strong>3 or more</strong> missed lesson reports without giving the student any prior notice, valid reasons, or explanation afterwards (apart from something out of their control i.e. seriously illness):</span></p>
<p>a.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If they contact us, explain in detail and show a strong desire that they still want to teach again, <strong>ban them for 3 months</strong>, then they are allowed to re-apply again. </span></p>
<p>b.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the teacher doesn't contact us or explain in detail but re-apply directly, they should be banned from re-applying <strong>permanently</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">After they re-apply, if they have been deactivated again by the TMS, they should be banned from italki permanently.</span></em></span></p>
