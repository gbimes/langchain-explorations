<p>Summary: Users from Mauritania will not sign up with Mobile, can only sign up using a third party or using email. This is because we are receiving 2,000+ SMS requests from Mauritania each week, but the actual amount of "real" users is only 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Affected amount of users: </strong></p>
<p>Around 2-3 users every week</p>

<h2><strong>Action Plan:</strong></h2>
<div>Team 1 will hotfix the issue by today (2021/5/4), just like the last time Mauritania, Algeria will also be blocked by mobile phone verification code registration. This is because 13,378 SMS messages were sent to Algeria in the last 14 days, but only one person registered.</div>
