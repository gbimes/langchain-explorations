<h3>Please do not offer free lessons on italki.</h3>
<p>We understand that it is common for offline private teachers or tutors to offer a free first lesson, but we believe that it is best for the italki online teaching community to charge at least a very small fee for the first class. This way, you are also more likely to get "serious" students who are dedicated to learning.</p>

<h3>What should I do during a trial lesson?</h3>
<p>It is up to you to decide how to structure your trial lessons.</p>
<p>We recommend using them as a way of exchanging introductions and giving a brief teaching demonstration so that both of you can determine whether working together is a good fit.</p>
<p>You might want to ask your student to give you some information before the lesson about their background as a language learner, their level, their reasons for studying a language, and if they have any material in particular that they want to use.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Couldn't complete the trial lesson?</h3>
<p>italki Students are only allowed one trial lesson per teacher. But, if your student misses their trial lesson with you, italki staff can replace it. Contact <a href="https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">italki support</a> (or advise your student to do this) with the<strong> Lesson ID #</strong> of the trial lesson.</p>
