<p>Once your video is ready, you can upload it in the application form <a href="https://teach.italki.com/apply/step/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://teach.italki.com/apply/step/3</a> - 3.2 Video Introduction</p>
<p>If you have previously uploaded a video on YouTube, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> it as an MP4 file and then upload it to italki.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01JCHTM54TT6WPZXX3PM4XAY5A">What if I want to update my video later?</h3>
<p>If you decide later that you want to update the video, you just need to go to <a href="https://teach.italki.com/console/basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacher Settings</a> &gt; Teacher Profile &gt; Video to change it.</p>
<p>After you have uploaded the video, it may take some time to process. After that, you will see a preview of the video.</p>
<p>Once the processing is complete, it will be sent to<strong> italki staff for approval</strong> before the change appears on your profile page. This may take 5 business days.</p>
