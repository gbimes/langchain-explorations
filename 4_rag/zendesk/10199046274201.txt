<h1>Pros and cons of using authentic materials in class</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ESL/EFL world, we often find ourselves with students that have very specific </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">goals in mind. However, the opposite is also true: English learners often find themselves just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to learn English for no apparent reason (academic or business). They just like to learn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">English and find it important to their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As English language “facilitators” we definitely want our prospective students to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enjoy a meaningful class, regardless of their goals. An excellent appendix to our classes has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do with authentic materials. That’s right: materials that were created (or someone else </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made them for us and we simply have a subscription that allows us to use them) to provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an insightful English class. Even though, as an ESL teacher, I believe that materials are the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">backbone of the student’s development, I assume there might some aspects that could be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put to the test, that necessarily won’t please our students, for some reason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">below some pros and cons of using authentic materials in class.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world at your fingertips</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could this be considered one of the “pros” and “cons”? Maybe. Why? We are talking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the Internet, of course. Countless resources can be found and used to teach our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students. However, there might be two downsides: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) The quality of the contents; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interest of the students. The teacher needs to make sure that the materials are of high </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quality and suitable for the student’s level. If you are like me, you will find yourself </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">struggling to have enough time to look for meaningful and precious materials that could be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">used. But time runs so fast… On the other hand, the students might just want a simple </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">article, mixed with a talking point and keyword discussion.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student wants a personalized experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tailored experience is hard to get. We all strive to get the best when we buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">something, don’t we? I’m sure that our students think the same when considering English </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">classes. If they look at their English adventure as an investment, they will likely privilege </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">having progress checkpoints, and even perhaps a tailored course plan made just for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much should you charge for a premium and tailored experience? It´s up to you! My </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience tells me that the students that reserve my classes prefer this approach. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what I offer. I’m holding no secrets! My advice is: Personalize your experience and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accompany it with quality and extraordinary performance AND authentic materials.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in a world of distress</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent events that are unique to our generation have taken place, so the whole </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">world Is being affected. The English language industry is no exception, however the need to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn English is still there, regardless of their reasons. A hands-on class in a conversational </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">style might just be what they want or… what they can afford. I’m confident that we, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers want to do our best to serve our students, and I’m sure we will serve our students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the best of our abilities, but at the same time we can’t forget our own goals.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros and cons of using authentic materials in class</span></h3>
<p><strong>The student doesn’t want a personalized experience</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. They just want to talk. Some students just want to focus on the idea </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that, by speaking, they can improve their English skills. I’m confident that you will assist the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students, maybe with just a simple topic, and then go on from there. In that case, I think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s no need to have authentic materials. The students merely want to focus their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attention on conversational English, and that’s ok. We just need to keep discerning what’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right path to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want grammar rules? Here you go!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think? Would it be practical to have authentic learning materials </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(“homemade” or licensed to be used) for these students? Likely, having a tailored course </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan, maybe with a couple of lessons that follow a certain pattern might just be what the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">student wants!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what now?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the best way to see if we should use authentic materials in class or not? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, a direct answer would be: please ask the student. They’re the judges </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the investors of their time in this endless quest; a magnificent journey, striving for an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exquisite proficiency level in the wonderful world of the English language! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to pose a challenge. Which of the subtitles mentioned above are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considered “pros”, and which ones are considered “cons”? Please leave your comments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You be the judge! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you. I wish you well in your endeavors!</span></p>
