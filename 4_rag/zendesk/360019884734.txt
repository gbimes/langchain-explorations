<h2>What should you do?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should respond to a lesson request as soon as possible so the student knows if they will have a lesson or not. Your options are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>Accept</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - If everything about it looks good, accept it to confirm that you will see the student at that requested time. </span>
</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, </span><strong>send a friendly message</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">
<strong>Add the student to your Skype</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or whichever communication tool you will use).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared - often, students don't know what to do, </span><strong>so the teacher should start the call to begin the lesson on time</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>Modify</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - If you need to suggest a change to the price or the time, </span><strong>do not accept the request</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><strong>but first, modify it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and propose these changes. The student will have an option to cancel if he or she disagrees with your proposed change.</span>
</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a message, so the student understands the reason for the proposed change.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Decline </strong>- If you are unwilling or unable to teach the student, decline the request right away. Now, the student's italki Credits will be available to make a request with a different teacher.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note: DO NOT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ignore the lesson request. </span><strong>DO NOT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accept and then propose to reschedule (unless you have already talked to the student). Always propose changes before accepting the request.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red">Students can schedule a lesson 2 or more hours in advance. Teachers have to respond to the lesson request within 48 hours or the lesson start time, whichever comes sooner.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lesson request will automatically expire and the italki Credits will be returned to the student. And the teacher’s attendance rate will be negatively affected.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Steps for processing a time change on the lesson request</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click "Change date/time" on the lesson request.</span></li>
<li>Select your new date/time. (<em>As a Teacher, you can select <strong>any date/time</strong>, even if it doesn't appear in your Teacher Calendar. This is useful <strong>if you want to offer a one-off lesson outside of your regular teaching schedule</strong> or for students<strong> making special requests for a specific time.</strong>)</em>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Confirm the new time/date.</li>
<li>Wait for the student to accept the new date/time change. (<em>The student has <strong>48 hours (or until the original lesson time proposed) </strong>to accept your proposed date/time change.  If no action is taken, the lesson request will be canceled.)</em>
</li>
</ol>
