<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wondered why a student didn’t book another lesson with you? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t an easy question to answer so we decided to ask 100 students for their reasons. </span></p>
<p><strong>1. My teacher failed to understand what I needed. I want to learn business English but all the exercise material is for general English only.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. My lessons with community tutors are just random chat. They got carried away with the chosen topic and failed to correct my spoken mistakes therefore I don’t feel I’ve made much improvement.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the webinar recording: </span><a href="https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001857763-2020-07-30-Best-Practices-in-Teaching-Conversation-Practice-Lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Practices in Teaching Conversation Practice</a></p>
<p><strong>3. My teacher didn’t do any preparation for the lesson. </strong></p>

<p><strong>4. My teachers spoke a lot without listening to me. I had no chance to practice as my teacher kept talking.</strong></p>
<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Check the </span><a href="https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/stt#:~:text=STT%20means%20Student%20Talking%20Time,for%20self%2Dreflection%20about%20teaching." target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn about student talk time.

<p><strong>5. There was an internet connection problem and my teacher didn’t handle it well.</strong></p>
<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always test your internet connection before the lesson and ensure that you and your student have agreed on a backup communication tool. If the lesson cannot continue, be professional and apologize for the less than perfect lesson experience as this will help you garner goodwill. Ask your student if they would like a refund or to reschedule the lesson and always respect their choice.</span></p>
<p><strong>6. My teacher was late and didn’t even apologize. She regularly reschedules or cancels lessons and sometimes notifies me at the last minute. Other times, she forgot our lessons.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always apologize to your student if you are late, explaining the reasons and try to make up for the missing lesson time caused by your late. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set an alarm for the upcoming lessons and ensure you will not forget about lessons. Actively manage your availability in your teacher calendar to avoid rescheduling and cancellation. If you have to, please notifies your student as early as possible.</span></p>
<p><strong>7. My teacher is a professional teacher with a structured lesson plan used for every student. However, the teacher failed to identify my needs and customize his teaching to fit me. I feel like a student in a traditional classroom.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always customize your teaching to your student’s needs, preferences and requirements. Make your lesson more student-centered.</span></p>
<p><strong>8. I am a beginner but my teacher spoke too fast and in long sentences.</strong></p>
<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak slower and clearer and use shorter sentences when teaching beginners.</span></p>
<p><strong>9. My teacher failed to clarify if he was going to use English to teach me German or use German to teach German. He never asked me.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ask your students their level of target language and find out what bridge language is required if your student’s level is below advanced.</span></p>
<p><strong>10. My teacher had a baby and it was too noisy having lessons with her.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em>Tip: </em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure a quiet teaching environment for lessons.</span></p>
<p><strong>11. The learning material my teacher provided was too difficult for me.</strong></p>
<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Learn better about your students’ level and provide material that is appropriate for your students’ level.</span></p>
<p><strong>12. My teacher raised his price.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Communicate price adjustments with your students and give them sufficient notice. Consider offering lower prices for your old students. You may change your price for the lesson requests from your old students by clicking "change price" button upon receiving the lesson request. You may also set another price for your old students by sending them a <a href="https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000107266-What-is-Lesson-Invitation-and-how-do-I-use-this-feature-video-subtitles-provided-in-English-Espa%C3%B1ol-Fran%C3%A7ais-Italiano-P%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lesson invitation</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>13. It was very hard to find a suitable time slot on my teacher’s calendar. She always asked me to wait.</strong></p>

<p><strong>14. My teacher took a one month break. I didn’t want to be left behind so I looked for a new teacher.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your students homework and tasks before leaving for your break. Keep in touch and check on their learning progress and let your student know when you will be back.</span></p>
<p><strong>15. Every lesson is nearly the same. I feel a bit bored having lessons with the teacher.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your students whether they want some changes in lesson arrangement, material and teaching methodology. Trying something new is a good way to motivate them to keep learning.</span></p>
<p><strong>16. I don’t have the motivation to learn any more. It’s too hard.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17. My teacher kept asking me to buy lessons and packages. I felt pressured.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain to your students what you can offer them and how you can help them achieve their learning goals instead of pushing them to purchase lessons.</span></p>
<p><strong>18. My teacher was great for the first 3 lessons. After I booked a package with him, he no longer took our lessons that seriously.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maintain professional standards, ethics and consistency otherwise your reputation may be negatively affected.</span></p>
<p><strong>19. My teacher was smoking whilst having lessons with me. He was not concentrating on our lessons.</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: </span></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoking, drinking or eating during lessons will distract your students from learning, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and therefore are not encouraged. Keeping focused on the lesson is the bare minimum expected of teachers and shows your respect for your students.</span></p>
<p><strong>20. My teacher asked me what I wanted to learn during the first lesson and did not teach at all. I was not sure whether I should book another lesson with her as the first lesson was ineffective and I felt my time was wasted.</strong></p>

<p><strong>25. I felt embarrassed that my teacher asked me about my personal life.</strong></p>
<p><em><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Tip:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In some cultures, students may feel uncomfortable when being asked about their personal life.
