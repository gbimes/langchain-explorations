<h1>The 10 Tips for a Great italki Headline</h1>
<p>Teachers who complete their headlines on their italki profile, on average see 3 times the profile clicks and increased bookings!</p>
<p><strong>Before we begin keep in mind a couple of rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Don't say something like, "I am the best teacher in italki." We have many great teachers and you are one of them, true, but not the only one. </strong></p>
<p><strong>- Don't say something like, " Top 5% on italki." italki doesn't actually rank teachers that way.  </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes time to write your italki headline, many teachers take an all-business approach, listing their training, experience, and statistics. That can be a great way to quickly tell incoming students the necessities. But could it be better? Your profile headline is your personal mission statement, your voice to catch students and tell them who you are. You are trying to intrigue and ensnare your audience to find out more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no formula for a great headline, but there are some considerations. To help you get inspired, here are 10 tips with examples to get students’ attention. Hopefully, they can inspire your next great headline. </span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>1. Motivate students with emotion and experience</h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For 10 years I've helped great learners find their passion and voice in Spanish no matter the level” </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students want to study and learn, and everyone has a different reason for studying, but we all want to enjoy the journey and speak fluently. A headline such as this not only says that you teach Spanish, but that you are individualistic and take students of all levels.  </span></p>

<h3>2. Share something personal to highlight your uniqueness </h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a weird Toyko Anime Nerd, ex-front-end software developer, teaching Japanese Basics to all”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know from this headline, that the teacher is maybe silly, not serious, likes anime, is from Tokyo, has experience in software development, and teaches Japanese. All that information for students to get to know the teacher in just 100 characters! And it shows the teacher’s personality to potential students.</span></p>

<h3>3. Highlight if you offer content and materials for learning  </h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I help turn French language learners into French speakers. Follow me for podcasts and more”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you create resources such as an italki podcast, videos, or homework and quizzes? Do you post in the community? Help your headline stand out by showing these added-value measures.         </span></p>

<h3>4. Make it about the students</h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Empowering people with language and learning”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and impactful a statement like this shifts the focus away from you the teacher and invites students to see themselves in your headline. It shows them that you have their goals first in your mind. It gives motivation to those looking to grow their opportunities and learn.  </span></p>

<h3>5. Be Honest, show your strengths, and don’t brag </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over 300 students have passed IELTS band 7.5 with my IELTS Test Prep Courses” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This simple statement can be powerful for students, and attract them to book. However, statements like this are similar to a promise to students. We want to make sure we can deliver on our end of the promise.</span></p>

<h3>6. Highlight your expertise and services</h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Need help reviewing and editing papers or resumes? Need some interview coaching? Come join my class!”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking some simple questions we can highlight the expertise and services we offer students. Maybe things outside of traditional language teaching. We avoid those common buzzwords and show that we are business language professionals. </span></p>

<h3>7. Use keywords not buzzwords or certificates</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Actress, drama and singing coach, writer, and digital media creator teaching Italian and Latin”</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headlines are searchable by students, so the words we put there can be found. Loading it up with keywords can attract the right students to find your profile. But remember you aren’t the only teacher on italki, so try to highlight those unique skills and avoid words like “experienced teacher” or “TEFL Certified”  </span></p>

<h3>8. Break rule 7, and make it all about the Buzzwords</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Professor Emeritus of Yonsei University, TKSOL Educator with 5000+ hours of experience in teaching”</em>   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have some experiences that really set you apart from others? We did say to stay away from buzzwords but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them when they are really going to make your headline shine.</span></p>

<h3>9. Share what you are learning with your students</h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Multi-lingual licensed teacher, teaching German. Learning Swahili, Urdu, Photoshop, and Python” </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People love shared experiences, including when their teacher understands the struggles they go through to learn a new language or skill. Showing your students that you are also a student can go a long way and show you are always improving your skills as a teacher too.  </span></p>

<h3>10. Relax, take a little risk, and have a bit of fun</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“I speak three languages English, bad English, and movie references, but at least my classes are fun” </em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of us are not so serious, and not every student is result-oriented, some are here to connect, learn, and share culture. Showing our silly side can be risky and potentially scare off students looking for a teacher, but if it is who you are, why not let your silly side shine.</span></p>
