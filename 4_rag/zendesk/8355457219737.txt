<h1>How good content helps you get rebooked</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of factors that help us in building and maintaining our business on italki. Our responsiveness to students, our profiles and videos, our service, our attitude in class, and good content. So, what is good content?  Here are some things to consider about content.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can make it and we can buy it</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live busy lives. Not all of us are artists, designers, have photoshop skills, sing, write, and so on… or have the time to create content even though we have those skills. Luckily there are lots of people and companies out there that do make content. Some even let us customize a bit.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy some class content and spruce it up with a bit of your own flair and tastes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find images online and borrow from sources </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build templates for quick easy content creation later.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks good</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesthetics can be tricky and different people have different tastes, but your content should reflect you and your teaching. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content should be concise, clear, and reflect your uniqueness. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be visually good-looking to you, colorful, and insightful. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be functional, students should want to use it to study and review.   </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps students review</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As teachers, we sometimes focus on the content in our lessons, but when it comes to rebooking the content we provide outside our lesson is just as important. Follow up class with various content.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercises based on the materials in class</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Quizzes </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further Resources </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide these things, but also understand that students may not use them. It is more the idea that you are providing the materials, not the use of materials that helps students rebook. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shows student’s progress</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an excellent progress report template, and taking a few moments after class to fill it out and send it creates a nice sense of closure and responsibility on the part of your students. It also creates a log of progression students have made</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to create a template that helps rate students on: pronunciation, speaking, listening, reading, comprehension, and fluency.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to judge these appropriately for a student's level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try scoring out of 5 or 10 stars for the day. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave space for some quick individual comments about the content, a memorable moment in class, or an explanation about the scoring.   </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is more than just in-class content</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with our great feedback report and providing links or copies of study materials to help guide students we can create different media to be used with many of our students. This can be catered to individuals or more broadly to help more of our students at once.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasts, create your own that reflects your teaching style and captures your voice to share with your students. You can level it for easy comprehension and talk about topics interesting to you and your students. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsletters &amp; Articles, create a monthly newsletter with fun cultural activities and updates can be a great way to share and keep connected to students outside of class. This allows you to also stay in touch with students who may not have booked in a while and remind them of your classes.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos, here we recommend treading lightly for two reasons. First, production values on YouTube and other platforms are high and hard to compete with, and having low production value can hurt your business. Secondly, creating videos demands a lot of time, and may not return as much in the way of bookings s other means.    </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is changing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering everything above the last key is simple, but not easy. You need to keep creating and keep changing/updating your content to keep it fresh. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try creating a content plan: time what content to create and when.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include when you will revisit things or update things.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make smaller changes frequently to ‘evolve’ the content. Rather than larger re-designs infrequently. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek inspiration, what are other creators doing that you can adapt and develop on your own. </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no one answer to getting and keeping students. Everything we do can contribute to or inhibit our success. But clear, usable, and attractive content always helps us provide the best to our students and help us keep them coming back for more. </span></p>
