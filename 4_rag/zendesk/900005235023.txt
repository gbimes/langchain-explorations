<h2 id="h_01EX1NYNVQ8VQ0W3YEA4HE9WTN"><strong>Possible Questions from users:</strong></h2>
<p>1.<strong> I can't open the Zoom on my phone</strong> through the link in the italki App.</p>
<p>The "auto-redirection" will not be supported until (possibly) our next New App version 3.30 by Feb 3rd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From teachers: </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Where can I set it up? </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://teach.italki.com/console/basic%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacher Settings page</a> &gt; Communication Tools </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. I've set this up but I can't see the option when sending my student a <strong>Lesson invitation.</strong></p>
<p>Lesson invitation currently not supported. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Can I delete my Zoom information after I set it up?</p>
<p>Yes, but please makes sure you have notified your student about this change if they have booked Zoom lessons with you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. Someone else joined my lesson somehow without my permission! Why?</p>
<p>Please enable passcode for your meetings to protect your privacy. </p>
<p>See Zoom help page: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832-Meeting-and-webinar-passcodes">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832-Meeting-and-webinar-passcodes</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. It's not lesson time yet but I received a notification that someone entered my meeting room?</p>
<p>After sharing your Zoom meeting links with your student, the meeting room is accessible anytime by your student. But if you're not online or you have set up a passcode, the meeting won't start without your permission. All you need to do is to conduct the lesson at the scheduled time. </p>
