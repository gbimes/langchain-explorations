<h2><strong>Tell the teacher your needs and your expectations </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before scheduling a lesson, click "Contact Teacher" to fill in the Contact Teacher form first and maybe give more details about your child’s language level, preferences, and lesson requirements.</span><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/900005708483/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good start of your communication with the teacher can help with making the most use of your lesson time. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Be there and supervise your child</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A child’s access to the internet and content needs to be monitored and supervised. You don’t necessarily need to accompany your child and make the video call with the teacher during the whole lesson time. But make sure you are aware of what’s going on and prepared for teacher’s communications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving your child alone in front of the computer or a device for an entire lesson is not recommended.</span></p>
