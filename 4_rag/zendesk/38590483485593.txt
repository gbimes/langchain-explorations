<h1>The Importance of Encouraging Students to Self-Study</h1>
<p><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">We all understand the importance of studying when learning a language. As teachers, we spend hours in the classroom working with students, guiding and supporting them. However, it is equally essential to encourage students to study independently outside of class. By doing so, they will improve their consistency, confidence, independence, and overall progress in the language they are striving to learn.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Consistency</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Like any skill, especially language learning, consistency is key. While many students take regular lessons on italki, this alone is often not enough to meet their language goals. That’s why students must maintain a consistent study routine outside the classroom. We can encourage this by advising students to review class notes and feedback, complete homework assignments, and engage with content in the target language. This will not only improve their performance in the classroom but also help them retain vocabulary, grammar concepts, and expressions more effectively—ultimately leading to more success in their target language. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Confidence</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Almost all language learners struggle with confidence at some point. It’s a common concern that teachers hear frequently. While students build confidence in their weak areas through lessons with their teachers, independent study can boost their confidence even more. This is because self-study empowers students to use the language on their own terms, without the guidance of a teacher. The goal of any language learner is to use the language independently, and that requires confidence. When students are encouraged to use their skills outside of the classroom, they begin to realize they are capable of communicating in the language they’ve worked so hard to learn, which reinforces their confidence.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Independence</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Another common challenge students face is not knowing the best way to study on their own. This can be frustrating since there is no universal method that works for every learner. Language learning is often a highly personal process. Through self-study, students can explore different approaches to see what works best for them, whether it’s through trial and error or experimentation with various resources. Teachers can provide guidance, but ultimately, the independence that comes from self-study allows students to tailor their learning experience to their personal needs and preferences.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">Progress</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #0e0e0e;">One of the biggest frustrations for language learners is the feeling of stagnation or lack of progress, which can happen at any level. However, it’s most commonly felt by students who reach an upper-intermediate or advanced level, often referred to as the “plateau.” This stage can be difficult to overcome, but it’s not impossible. With consistent self-study, alongside classroom support from their teachers, students can push through this plateau. It’s essential for teachers to encourage self-study to help students continue progressing in the target language they’ve worked so hard to master.</span></p>
