<h1>Games for 1-1 online language lessons</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has shown that using games to teach a language can make learning much easier by increasing motivation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For specific language areas (like grammar), games are just as effective compared to traditional teaching methods. A welcome break from textbooks, games take an interactive approach to learning. This is especially helpful for less confident or frustrated students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games also help you stand out as a teacher—after all, who’s more fun, the teacher who plays games or the teacher who relies on the textbook only? </span></p>
<p><strong>1. Heads Up</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this game the teacher shows the student a series of words (such as capital cities) and the student describes them to the teacher. The teacher then guesses what the word is based on the student’s description. You could add a time limit for each word to increase the pressure!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might sound simple, but it’s great fun, and a really effective way to review vocabulary. Students are actually paraphrasing during this game, which is especially useful for advanced students. If a student's level isn’t high enough to describe the word in their own words, the roles can be switched. Why not try playing this as a warm-up, and see if students remember what they learned in the last lesson? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the video of Ellen playing Heads Up.</span></p>

<p><strong>2.  Fortune Teller</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune Teller is a role-playing game that encourages students to ask questions in </span><strong>the future tense</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the Fortune Seeker, your student asks you open questions they would like to know about their future selves, such as “When will I meet my wife?”. Creativity is a must for this game, so don’t be afraid to have fun and be silly as you play. </span></p>
<p><strong>3. Password</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this game the student guesses the answer from single word clues given by the teacher. It’s a great game to encourage a deeper understanding of vocabulary through word association and synonyms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the video of the Password game played in the “Best of Tonight” show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/McaQMJwqn50" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Never Have I Ever</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use this as a warm up, or use it to practice speaking about experiences in the present perfect tense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this game, the student will talk about an experience they’ve never had before. If the teacher has had this experience before, the teacher responds “yes” and discusses their experience to the student. If the teacher has never had this experience either, the student can imagine and explain to the teacher what this experience would be like for them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>5. The Whisper Challenge (Advanced learners)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this game one silently mouths words or phrases to the other. It’s best to limit the amount of words to make guessing easier. You can also choose idioms or random sentences for more advanced students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game is actually a fun way to practice lip reading and enunciation! Lip reading is a significant element of speech interpretation, especially in noisy environments. This is demonstrated by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McGurk Effect</a>, an interesting concept you could introduce your students. </span></p>
<p><strong>6. Box of Lies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of just recognising vocabulary words, this exercise requires students to put together coherent descriptions and use prepositions correctly. This is a great game to challenge your student’s creativity, active recall, and vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the game, the student draws something on a paper. They can truthfully describe the picture in every detail or tell a lie by inventing a different description. The teacher guesses whether the student is telling the truth or a lie. If the teacher makes a wrong guess, the student should comfort the teacher using different words every time. If the teacher makes a right guess, the student should give a compliment using different words every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the video playing the Box of Lies game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Md4QnipNYqM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>7. Word mazes are great for teaching pronunciation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word mazes are a puzzle where students must follow the correct sequence of words to make their way from the start of the maze to the finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word stress mazes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://support.italki.com/hc/article_attachments/900003579563" alt="Screenshot_2020-09-17_at_13.21.15.png"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being aware of syllable stress is crucial for helping non-native speakers improve their pronunciation and comprehensibility. Word-stress mazes get students grappling with stressed syllables. Though the templates here are only applicable to English, but you can come up with a similar game for your students.</span></p>
