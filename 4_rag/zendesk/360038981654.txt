<p>Asking new students what they want to learn before their first lesson will increase the chances of them booking another lesson with you.</p>
<p>Here’s why.</p>
<p><strong>Students can tell immediately that you are someone who goes the extra mile to care personally about their needs. </strong>They know the first lesson will not be a waste of time as you go through the tedious steps of ascertaining what their requirements are for the entire thirty minutes. You’ve already done your homework. You can pinpoint their needs ahead of time, and zero in on something during the first lesson.  They won't hesitate to book another lesson with you as they know how you teach and what the second lesson will be like. </p>
<p><strong>Secondly, reaching out ahead of time shows good customer service and professionalism.</strong> The Italki staff have received good feedback from students about specific teachers—those who’ve asked for the requirements before their first lesson. This practice not only made the students feel valued and established rapport from day one but also demonstrated the teachers’ dedication to his/her profession.  </p>
<p><strong>Third, you become the teacher that stands out from the crowd. </strong>Italki has a policy: Each italki student has only three chances of taking trial lessons with three different teachers. Imagine this scenario: a student books trial lessons with three teachers. Teachers A and B spent 30 minutes asking what the student would like to learn in their first sessions.  Teacher C, however, fully understood the student’s needs before their first lesson commenced and had a very prepared and customized lesson ready to go. </p>
<p><em>Which teacher would you choose?</em></p>
<p>Spending just a moment of time reaching out ahead of time can make all the difference to your new students. This practice can make an excellent first impression, and it can help your students to feel more comfortable and relaxed in their first lesson with you. It can also help you to feel more prepared. Try it out for yourself to see how it can impact the number of students who choose to rebook with you. </p>
<p><strong>How do you reach out to your students?</strong></p>
<p>A student who has never booked a lesson with you now cannot directly message you. Instead, he/she must click the “contact teacher” button to submit a contact teacher form to you. The contact teacher form lists some questions related to student learning requirements. You will receive the contact teacher forms in your messages.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure you check your messages and follow up with those students</strong>. This is very important! They will be your potential students and may book a lesson with you if you are able to understand their requirements and provide good customer service. The questions asked on the contact teacher form can be changed by selecting other questions or setting up your own question in Teacher Settings&gt;&gt;Teacher Profile&gt;&gt;Contact Form.  You may prepare your first lesson with the new student by understanding the answers on the contact teacher form.</p>

<p>Students do have the option of directly booking a lesson with you without filling out the contact teacher form. Please note that we highly encourage teachers to message new students about their learning requirements, motivation and language proficiency level after they send a lesson request to you.</p>
