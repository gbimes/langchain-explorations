<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from March 10, Visa and MasterCard will suspend operations in Russia by blocking all transactions outside of Russia for cards issued by Russian banks. It will influence all international payments including Google Play, Apple Pay, and any direct online payments. Therefore, it won’t be possible to pay in italki as well.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of a problem with payment, please contact the customer service of this bank to clarify whether it is related to sanctions and disconnection from SWIFT.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the credits that you have purchased are safe in your account.  The credits will not disappear and of course, you are free to use them in the system.  We are truly sorry as we understand the situation our users from Russia are in.  We are actively working on this problem. We hope that everything will be back to normal soon!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Teachers: Withdrawals</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, we know that PayPal and Payoneer have stopped working in the territory of the Russian Federation, therefore these withdrawal methods will be temporarily unavailable.</span></p>

We will do everything possible to protect your funds and ensure the safe withdrawal of your credits.</span></p>
