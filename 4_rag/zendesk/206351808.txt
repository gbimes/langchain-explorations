<h1>Withdraw using Bank Transfer via Payoneer</h1>
<p>All bank transfer requests <strong>require a Payoneer account. </strong>If Payoneer is not available in your country, please consider a different Payment Provider or contact italki support for help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bank Transfer (by Payoneer)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bank Transfer by Payoneer is available only for withdrawals of<strong> $30 USD in italki Credits or more</strong>. If this is a problem, please contact support directly.</li>
<li>If you have not yet created a Payoneer account, please begin this process at least 1 week before you want to make your withdrawal request, since Payoneer may take at least a few days to verify your account.</li>
<li>Requests for Bank Transfer via Payoneer are collected twice a month, on the 15th and on the last day (30th / 31st) of each month. Requests are collected according to UTC+0 time, so please plan accordingly.</li>
<li>All payments will be sent out during the following 10 days, so your payment will be sent by the 26th (if submitted before the 15th) or by the 10th of the following month (if submitted at the end of the month). It may take a few extra days for the payment to be received by your bank.
