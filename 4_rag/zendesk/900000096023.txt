<h1>Case Study: Staying on italki For More Than 1 Year With Less Than 50 lessons</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been on italki for more than a year with less than 50 completed lessons, you may need to use a strategy employed by new teachers:</span><strong> lower pricing </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and changing your </span><strong>availability to suit your students’ preferred lesson times</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this is that you don’t yet have enough lesson statistics to attract the large proportion of students who prefer more experienced (in terms of the number of lessons) teachers. Your initial objective is to build up momentum and increase your number of completed lessons and student reviews. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please review your profile and make sure it fulfils these requirements:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower lesson rates and a schedule that matches the peak times of your major student markets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important to take into account what time you make yourself available. Your students come from all over the world and as a result, there will be different time zones for you to consider when setting your availability. The average italki student is a working adult who prefers lessons after work and is more flexible on weekends.

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A good introduction video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak normally (not too fast) and make sure your voice can be heard clearly without background noise. The background in your video is not too cluttered and there’s good lighting. If you teach kids you should include some teaching tools (ie. black boards, flash cards, props, puppets) in your video.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A well-written introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research other teachers’ profiles and see what you like and don’t like. Generally speaking, it’s good to let potential students know about what your interests are, what you do, where you’ve been. You should also mention your work/teaching experience and what you specialize in. Definitely mention any experience you have of learning languages and what those languages are.</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a Community Tutor, you may mention more about your personality, life experience, hobbies and the proficiency/accent of your teaching language. If you are a Professional Teacher, you may want to mention more about your teaching qualifications and experience.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Information about your lessons</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should choose a specialization as this allows you to focus on your strengths. In the long run you’ll develop your reputation in this area and that will give you a very solid foundation for attracting students. Do not offer many different types of lessons because you think this will make you more appealing to a wider audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may, in fact, have the opposite effect and lead to students questioning whether you have the necessary experience and knowledge to teach these lessons. Teaching what you are good at is important for your reputation and teaching career. Meanwhile, consider the student market for your lessons. A teacher offering a lesson called “Football English” may find it hard to attract students because the market is too niche.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you have assigned</span><a href="https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000047946-What-are-lesson-categories-and-tags-and-how-do-I-set-them-up-"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lesson categories and tags </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to your lessons as this is another way for a student to find you via the lessons you offer rather than where you are from and the language you teach.</span></p>
