</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I can expect from the Trial lesson?</strong></p>
<p>Although different teachers might have different content in trial lessons, usually it involves the discussion of your learning needs, the demo of the teaching style, the teaching materials and the suggested frequency of learning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I need to prepare for the Trial lesson?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend you to share your learning preferences and language level to the teacher as well as where you want to be. You can take a language test on italki before the lesson. Such information will help teachers understand you better and provide suitable content during the Trial lesson.</p>
