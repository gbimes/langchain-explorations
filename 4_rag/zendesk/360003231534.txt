<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;italki does not tolerate teachers trying to take italki students off of italki or accepting payments outside of the italki system. &lt;strong&gt;Advertising lessons outside of the system or avoiding the italki scheduling and payment systems may be grounds for your account being suspended or deactivated. italki will also confiscate any earned italki Credits, and you may lose access to your lesson and teaching history on italki.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not do this.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Company who's trying to steal teacher from italki, here's a previous response from Kevin Chen as a reference:</span></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Tyler,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Kevin Chen, and I'm a co-founder of italki.  I'm sorry about introducing myself in this way, but our support team has let me know that you're trying to recruit teachers on our site.  This violates our terms of service, among other things. It's pretty inappropriate for a company like Lingo-live to behave this way, and it borders on being ethically questionable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don't want any bad relationships, so I'm going to directly ask you and your team to stop this type of behaviour.  We think language learning is a very big market, and It shouldn't be necessary for startups to use underhanded methods to compete.  There are big opportunities for all edtech companies, and I hope we all can work to improve education for students everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Chen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder, </span><a href="http://italki.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">italki.com</span></a></p>
