<h1>Why hasn’t my lesson request been accepted?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A teacher will have a maximum of 48h (or the lesson starts time, whichever is sooner) to respond to a lesson request. </span></p>
<p><strong>Your lesson is booked successfully only after your lesson request is accepted by your teacher. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want to wait, simply filter by <strong>“Auto-accept”</strong> on the teacher search list to find teachers instantly accepting lesson requests automatically.</span></p>
