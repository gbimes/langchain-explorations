<p>But don’t worry if you forget to do so - italki will automatically confirm it as completed<strong> three days after the lesson time.</strong></p>

<p>A good lesson comment includes enough detail to give other students an idea of what a lesson was like. Providing your overall lesson experience will be very helpful for other users! Try to be specific - you can offer your view on what the teachers did well, and how they can improve. Constructive feedback will motivate the teachers to keep doing better. </p>
<p><strong>Bear in mind that your feedback is public and cannot be edited once successfully submitted. It will be on the teacher’s profile page.</strong> So try to increase the relevance of your feedback, stick to the facts, and be honest and friendly!</p>
