<h1>Case study: Coming back to teaching after a long break</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many teachers experience difficulties in getting a sufficient lesson amount after taking a long break from teaching. All their old students have gone and may have found new teachers. If you are in the same boat, here are some suggestions for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you can do is contact all your old students and let them know you’re teaching again. It would make sense for you to incentivize them by offering them preferential pricing. Do bring yourself up to date with their progress during this time and understand their objectives, wants and needs as they may have changed since you last taught them.</span> </p>
