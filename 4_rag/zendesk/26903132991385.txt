<h1>The Teacher Management System</h1>
<p><strong>What is the Teacher Management System?</strong></p>
<p>italki expects teachers to be professional and provide quality service to their students. To this end, the Teacher Management System enforces italki’s policies and code of conduct. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We understand that even the best teachers will get bad reviews, miss an occasional class, or have a student complain about them. In moderation, none of those are likely to raise concerns or impact the Teacher Management System. However, when we see repeated or extremely unprofessional conduct we may restrict teachers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What actions are monitored by the Teacher Management System?</strong> </p>
<p>We have identified a series of actions that will greatly affect the students’ experiences and therefore impact your student rebook rate. These actions will be monitored closely and trigger different levels of discipline. </p>
<p>The behaviors below are listed based on their severity:</p>
<p>Being absent from a lesson without giving notice </p>
<p>Missing or Not replying to lesson requests</p>
<p>Being absent from a lesson with notice </p>
<p>Canceling a lesson  </p>
<p>Declining a lesson request </p>
<p> </p>
