<ol>
<li>You have no lessons under these statuses: upcoming, action required, waiting. (check here: <a href="https://teach.italki.com/lessons/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://teach.italki.com/lessons/sessions</a>)</li>
<li>You have no packages under these statuses: active, action required, temporarily frozen. (check here: <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://teach.italki.com/lessons/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://teach.italki.com/lessons/packages</a>)</li>
<li>You understand that you have to <a href="https://teach.italki.com/application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-apply</a> if you want to resume teaching on italki. Your lesson history will be saved.</li>
